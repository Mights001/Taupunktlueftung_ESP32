"# Taupunktlueftung_ESP32" 
This is a Taupunktl√ºftungssteuerung (dew point ventilation control) ESP32 sketch. Two DHT22 sensors are required to measure temperature and humidity. The web server includes a WLAN AP for initial setup, after which the values can be adjusted. Firmware changes can be made via OTA (over-the-air) updates.
